## The IguanaWorks daemon (igdaemon) as a few common-line options that
## are configured here.

## There are multiple logging levels for igdaemon
## 0 = normal
## 1 = log info
## 2 = log debug1
## 3 = log debug2 (excessive)
## 4 = log debug3 (excessively excessive)
LOGLEVEL="0"

## Because of a bug in libusb, using threads when communicating with
## our device can cause the device to hang. As a work around, we have
## an option to disable using threads. This option may cause problems
## when sending long IR signals and will take a slightly larger amount
## of overhead on your computer. Unless you have problems with the
## threadless version, we recommend using it for increased stability.
## The option to disable threads is:
## "--no-threads"

## Uncomment the line below to disable threads
#OPTIONS="--no-threads"

## If you enable threads, then you can decrease the receive timeout
## because it does not limit how quickly you can send. It does limit
## how quickly you can quit the daemon. With threads enabled, we set
## this timeout to 1000ms. With threads disabled, we put the timeout
## at 50ms. You can use a larger value if you want to save a little
## amount of cpu time, but it may cause problems with sends, 
## particularly long send.

## With the --no-threads option used
#RECEIVETIMEOUT="50"

## When threads are used (and not --no-threads)
RECEIVETIMEOUT="1000"

## the igdaemon can use different backend USB drivers and should be
## told which to try first since we prefer the libusb driver to the
## libusbpre1.0
DRIVERS="--driver=libusb"

## You can set the timeout value for sendings IR signals. This set how
## long to wait for send to successfully complete before assuming that
## the send failed and returning an error. Time is measured in ms and
## the default is 1000. Do not change this unless you have good
## reason.
SENDTIMEOUT="1000"

## The init.d script for igdaemon auto detects what distro you are
## using (fedora, debian, ubuntu, gentoo). You can overwrite this
## detection by uncommenting one of the lines below. If your distro is
## not detected, please send a ticket to:
## http://iguanaworks.net/projects/IguanaIR/
## Including your distribution and the entire contents of /etc/issue.
## We will try to add support for your distro in the next release. In
## the meantime, maybe try some of the other distro overrides.
#DISTRO="fedora"
#DISTRO="debian"
#DISTRO="ubuntu"
#DISTRO="gentoo"
